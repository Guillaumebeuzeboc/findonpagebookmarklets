# FindOnPage Bookmarklets
Add dynamically page highlighting buttons according to a previous Google search. Meant to become a replacement for the famous SearchWP on Firefox Quantum.
<br/><br/>
Bookmarklets are bookmarks with javascript instead of normal URLs. They show up in "button" form when located in the bookmarks toolbar. A click on such a button will highlight text on any page and jump to the first occurrence.<br/><br/>

First make the bookmarks toolbar visible, e.g. via a right-click on the three horizontal bars in the browser's upper right corner.
Personally, I prefer to have the old fashioned menu bar (File/View/...) visible as well, because I can drag the bookmark toolbar's content into that menu bar, too, using "Customize..." and then make the bookmarks toolbar invisible again to save one row (see the next screenshot)<br/><br/>

If your screen resolution is high enough to fit much into one row, you can integrate the bookmark toolbar's content into the menu toolbar via Customize... (right-click on the three horizontal bars for Settings), since you need to add one row for the bookmark buttons anyway, and sometimes the direct acces to File/View is handy. Then you can uncheck the now empty bookmarks toolbar because everything happens in the menu bar now.<br/><br/>
